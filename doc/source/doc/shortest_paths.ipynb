    "Storm can enumerate the most probable paths of a model, leading from the initial state to a defined set of target states, which we refer to as shortest paths.\n",

    "The underlying implementation uses the *recursive enumeration algorithm* [[JM1999]](#jm1999), substituting distance for probability – which is why we refer to the most probable paths as the *shortest* paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm computes the shortest paths recursively and in order, i.e., to find the 7th shortest path, the 1st through 6th shortest paths are computed as precursors. The next (i.e., 8th shortest) path can then be computed efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to note that *any* path is eligible, including those that (repeatedly) traverse loops (i.e., *non-simple* paths). This is a common case in practice: Often a large number of similar paths that differ only in the order and number of loop traversals occur successively in the sequence of shortest paths. (For applications that are only interested in simple paths, this is rather unfortunate.)"
